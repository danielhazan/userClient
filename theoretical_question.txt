1 pro and 1 con for implementation a, b : 

a.

pro:  saving the token locally may lower dramatically the overhead on server because of fewer http requests. 

con: the token may change dynamically (as the user edit it). thus, there is a possiblity that our 'saved' token will become invalidated.

b.

pro - re-requesting a token from the server each time the app launches keeps the token authenticated with the user who is launching the app. thus it may be more scure.

con - a lot of http requests and high overhead for many app requests.
